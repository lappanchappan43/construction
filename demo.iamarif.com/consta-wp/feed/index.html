				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Besides finding current construction projects, Building Radar offers you the opportunity for a real-time search of requests for proposal (RFP) of thousands of sources with intelligent filters. Requests for proposal have always been an important source of orders within the construction industry and construction supplies. In the EU alone, several billions of Euros are generated by these types of contracts. These types of rfp s fundamentally differ from whole construction projects. In this article, we will explain what exactly a rfp is, why they are so important and why they can contribute significantly to your company’s business success.</p>
<p>Public tendering or submissions, in English often called “tenders” or “RFPs”, are requests to submit a quote. A request for proposal itself is not a quote but rather informs possible buyers about its requirements and therefore provides suppliers with the opportunity to adjust to the requirements of the customer. For the future customers, this has the benefit that they do not have to actively look for suppliers. For the provider, on the other hand, this makes it possible to source more orders. Overall, it aims to harness the potential of the free economy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One Sunday in May, many countries celebrate mother’s day in order to thank their mothers for all the hard work and effort they put in the education of everyone of us. This special occasion will occur this Sunday. So we take the opportunity to thank our mothers with a very Building Radar like article. For mother’s day Building Radar wants to allude to all mothers and how they have been an inspiration to several architects. The constructions in this articles have been directly or indirectly been inspired by the architects mothers.</p>
<p>This home tries to blend in its environment while taking a unique turn on geometrical conventions. The idea arose from Marc Koehler’s mother. The original intent for the house’s construction was a gift for her. In the end of the project, she kept the house. It was called the House in House because of the separate entrance to the office space giving a twofold appearance and function to the house. The layout of the house is a result of a combination of three enclosed volumes and the common spaces in between them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To get data for the construction industry in Europe can be a pain. Building Radar is all about reducing pain and collecting data. This is why we wanted to make some construction data for the European markets freely available here. This site gives an overview of statistical data from a vast amount of sources. Due to missing figures in some countries, it was not possible up until to date to provide a full set of information on every country. This market data is the most recent available, which for the most part has been raised between 2012 and 2014. No set is older than 2011. The major parts of the construction industry in Europe publicized data for 2014. This will thus be the base for the following data.</p>
<p>There are various criteria that decide over who wins a request for proposal. They are, however, clearly communicated to help you to adjust your application accordingly.</p>
